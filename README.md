Created with minor, readily available components like an Ultrasonic sensor and a Buzzer, Smart Car Reversing System is created with the modern traffic and parking limitations in mind. The car model uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect the wall or obstacle distance behind the car and sends a warning sound through the buzzer.
